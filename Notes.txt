---------------------    Styles in HTML     --------------------

- Styles are additional attributes defined for HTML elements to make the presentation more interactive and Responsive.
        <h2 align=""> Welcome</h2>

- Styles are applied to any HTML in 3 ways.
    1. Inline
    2. Embeded 
    3. External [CSS - Cascade Style Sheet]

Inline Styles:
    - syles are defined for every element individually by using a "style" attribute.
    syntax:
        <h1 style="color: red; text-align: center"></h1>

    - Inline styles are faster in rendering.
    - we can't re-use the styles.
    
    Note:
        If one is looking for styles without regular extensions[changes] and reusability then it is better to use Inline.
    
Embeded Styles:
    - styles are defined in an seperate <style> container and are kept in <head> or <body> section.

        <style>
            selector{
                attribute: value;
            }
        </style>

    - You can easily extend the styles and re-use the styles
    - But embedded styes are slow in rendering compared to inline styles
    - Embeded styles are only for a specific page. If you want the style across various pages then they are not available.
    
Note:
    - The MIME type [Multi Purpose Internet MAil Extension] for styles is 

            MIME type               Extension
            -------------           ----------------------------
            image/jpeg              .jpg, .jpeg, .jfif
            application/msword      .doc, .docx, .rtf, .txt

        - the MIME type is uesd by the rendering engine to process the code block written in page.
        - the MIME tyoe for CSS is "text/css".
    - The Media type for styles defines how to display various media content which includes screen, print and speech.
        - You can classify the content for different media devices.

        syntax:
            <style type="text/css" media=" all | screen | print | speech ">

            </style>


    - You can embed styles in both <head> and <body>. The difference between them is that the styles in head section are intended to
    load into browser momery and then accessed by page. Styles in body section are directly rendered into page, without loading into
    memory.

    - You can keep styles outside HTML scope but it is not recommended. 

Extenal styles:
    - You can write and save styles in a seperate styles style sheet with the extension ".css"
    - So that you can link the style sheet to any HTML page and access styles across pages.
    - You can use "Cascading Technique".[CSS]
    
    Note:
        Using an external style sheet will increase the number of requests for a page and also page load time.
